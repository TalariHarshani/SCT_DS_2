# SCT_DS_2
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset. Handled missing values, transformed features, and visualized survival trends by gender, class, and age. Generated insights with plots and correlation heatmaps for better understanding of data.

# Project Overview
- Analyzed the Bank-Full dataset (UCI / Kaggle) to study customer behavior.
- Objective: Identify key factors influencing subscription to a term deposit (y).
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and correlations.
# Key Highlights
- Distribution by Job – Compared how different professions respond to marketing campaigns.
- Marital Status – Checked variation in subscription outcomes across marital groups.
- Education Levels – Analyzed effect of education on customer decisions.
- Housing Loan & Personal Loan – Studied their influence on subscription patterns.
- Subscription Outcome (y) – Visualized the balance of yes/no responses.
- Correlation Heatmap – Explored relationships among numeric variables (age, balance, duration, campaign, previous).
# Tools & Libraries
- Pandas – Data loading and manipulation
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Seaborn – Advanced plotting
# Insights
- Customers from specific job categories (such as management and retired) show higher success rates.
- Education level significantly affects the likelihood of a positive subscription.
- Clients with housing or personal loans display different response behaviors.
- Call duration has the strongest positive correlation with successful subscription.
